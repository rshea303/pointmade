# Pointmade

Thanks for your interest in a front-end role at Proofpoint Security Awareness
Training! This repo contains a toy version, implemented in [Ember
3.8](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.8), of our real product. Its purpose is to
help simulate "real work" as much as possible within the constraints of our
interview process. Please
[duplicate](https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository) this
repo to a :lock: **private** repository, and add the Proofpoint hiring manager
you are communicating with as a collaborator. Then watch for your first
interview task as a GitHub issue.

In the mean time, read on for how to set up the project locally ...
